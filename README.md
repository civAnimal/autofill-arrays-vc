## AutoFill Arrays For VS Code

This plugin allows you to fill `Arrays` with lists of interesting/meaningful words or numbers by typing just a few keys. You have a choice to pick from several available categories. It works equally well in all mainstream programming languages, like `Python`, `Javascript`, `Java`, `C`, `C++`, `C#`, `Lua`, `Ruby`, etc. You could also use it with other array-like collection objects/types, like `List`, `Set`, `Tuple`, etc.

### Tips

* Type only a few letters of the desired category. If you don't see VS Code's AutoComplete System responding to your typing, then you could activate it manually by pressing `ctrl + space`.

* Most categories comprise several short (5 elements) and long (>= 10 elements) lists. Explore them and incorporate them in your workflow accordingly.

* With a combination of few key-strokes, you could construct quite long lists within a matter of seconds.


### Installation

* From VS Code press `ctrl + shift + x` or do : _View_ â†’ _Extensions_ to open Extensions panel.
* Search for the extension: `AutoFill Arrays` and install it.
